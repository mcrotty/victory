## About us

The Slaney Purple Paddlers is a dragon boat team based in the Wexford Boat and Tennis club, Wexford, Ireland. The team members have one thing in common, they have been diagnosed with breast cancer and have set up a dragon boat team to:

– get fit
– enjoy the mutual support of team mates
– raise awareness of breast cancer.

We were all new to the sport and are inspired by the 150 or so breast cancer dragon boat teams worldwide. 

### Why dragon boats? 

We are the first dragon boat team in Ireland. The team was set up by Fiona Tiernan, in order to keep fit after a recurrence of breast cancer. From a membership of 2 and no boat in 2010, we now have 80+ active members, a wonderful coach Julie Doyle and two dragon boats.

We train on the water twice a week during Spring and Summer months, and once a week during the rest of the year (view map – you can click on the map to enlarge it) and have members aged from early 30′s to 70 plus.
The other thing we all have in common is that we were all new to the sport of dragon boat racing.
