## Try it out!

New members are always welcome. The only criteria is that you must have been diagnosed with breast cancer and be at least 3 months post-treatment. Our members range in ages from early 30’s to 70 plus.

We hold ‘Come and Try’ sessions throughout the year. If you are living in the greater Dublin area and would like to get involved, please contact us at info@slaneypurplepaddlers.com to find out more information and to see when our next ‘Come and Try’ session is being held.

To find out more about the sport of dragon boating in Ireland, including other breast cancer support clubs and general clubs in your area, visit the Irish Dragon Boat Association (IDBA) at www.dragonboat.ie
